# Udacity Cybersecurity Course Project 1

You have been hired to secure the PC used at your friend’s business: Joe's Auto Body. Joe provides car repair services throughout the tri-state area. He suspects that others may have broken into his PC and could be using it to transfer files across the internet. He has asked that you secure it for him according to industry best practices, so it can be once again used as a standard PC.

You will be given access to a virtual image of Joe’s Auto Body’s PC. It’s a copy of the actual computer operating system in use that will be transferred to Joe’s computer once you are done. You will also be given a document template that contains the high-level steps you’ll need to take as part of securing a typical computer system. For each step, you need to write your answers in the document template, explain how you got the answers, and provide screenshots showing your work.
